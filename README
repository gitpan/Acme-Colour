NAME
    Acme::Colour - additive and subtractive human-readable colours

SYNOPSIS
      # light
      $c = Acme::Colour->new("black");
      $colour = $c->colour; # black
      $c->add("red");   # $c->colour now red
      $c->add("green"); # $c->colour now yellow

      # pigment
      $c = Acme::Colour->new("white");
      $c->mix("cyan");    # $c->colour now cyan
      $c->mix("magenta"); # $c->colour now green

DESCRIPTION
    The Acme::Colour module mixes colours with human-readable names.

    There are two types of colour mixing: the mixing of lights and the
    mixing of pigments. If one take two differently coloured beams of light
    and projects them on to a screen, the mixing of these lights occurs
    according to the principle of additive colour mixing. If one mixes two
    differently coloured paints they mix according to the principle of
    subtractive colour mixing.

METHODS
  new()

    The new() method creates a new colour. It takes an optional argument
    which is the initial colour used:

      $c = Acme::Colour->new("black");

  colour()

    The colour() method returns the current colour. Note that
    stringification of the colour object magically returns the colour too:

      $colour = $c->colour; # black
      print "The colour is $c!\n";

  add()

    The add() method performs additive mixing on the colour. It takes in the
    colour to add in:

      $c->add("red");

  mix()

    The mix() method performs subtractive mixing on the colour. It takes in
    the colour to mix in:

      $c->mix("cyan");

NOTES
    A good explanation of colour and colour mixing is available at:

    No, "colour" is not a typo.
